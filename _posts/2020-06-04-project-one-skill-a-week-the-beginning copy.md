## Project One Skill A Week: The Beginning
=======================================

Jul 4, 2020·3 min read


I work as a copywriter, which means that I got into the business hoping to quench my creative thirst, and ended up realizing that the world is much bigger than the open-eyed dreams of my naïve early-20s self.

I do love my job, and I thank my stars on most days (except Mondays) for being able to make a living by writing — I can’t imagine doing anything else. But after 4 years of working, things are beginning to get monotonous. So here’s an attempt to shake them up a bit.

I have been considering a side project for the longest time. Credit where it’s due, [Ximena Vengoechea](https://medium.com/u/72e8f2aaaeca?source=post_page-----2e9ca843bd7a--------------------------------)’s website and blogs inspired me to finally power up my laptop after work hours and start a side project that may or may not directly help my career.

Now, a little bit of context. I was a nerd in school. And I was in school before being a nerd was cool. Loved writing exams, took pride in correcting everyone, the whole shebang. But I haven’t made an attempt to **_actively learn_** learn something new since I finished my undergrad. Working in a field as dynamic as advertising, I learn a lot by getting my hands dirty every day. Nobody teaches you the tricks that eventually help you write faster and better, or negotiate deadlines with the servicing people, or sell your campaign ideas to the clients. I plan to add some **_active learning_** to this passive activity.

Going forward, every week, I will put 4 to 10 hours to learn a new skill, and write about it at the end of the week. I won’t limit myself to the subjects I’ll pick, the sky is the limit! It might be Graphic Design next week, Website Coding in Week 7 and City Planning in Week 14! I haven’t planned it in advance, and I am not going to hold myself back.

**Why (_only_) 4 to 10 hours?**

I want to see how far I get by putting in a little bit of effort each week! See how smarter I can get, how much it helps with my writing… I have a real positive feeling about this.

This is the maximum amount of time I can dedicate to this project, even then, I might end up skipping a week here due to time constraints.

**Why not pick one thing and stick to it for a year?**
======================================================

1.  It’s monotonous. No. Can. Do.
2.  I wouldn’t know how to pick ONE skill, I have too many micro-interests.
3.  I am hoping that trying a lot of new things will help me navigate the next steps in my professional life more efficiently. Will I like screenwriting more, or will I take to graphic design? Or will digital marketing swoop in to take the pie…

Disclaimer: I might have dabbled with a few of these ‘new’ skills before, so I’ll be sure to give a heads up at the top of my weekly reports.

I will also share links to all the resources I use to learn the new skills or subject. If I spend more than 10 hours on a certain skill due to any reason, I’ll be sure to write a report before I begin the 11th hour so that my weekly reports are uniform.

Lastly, I am putting this down on medium.com for a little bit of support and a lot of cheers. Things are tough, and I am not going to pretend like I don’t need ’em.
