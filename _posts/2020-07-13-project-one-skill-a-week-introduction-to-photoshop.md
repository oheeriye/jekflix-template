## Project One Skill A Week: Introduction to Photoshop
=======================================

Jul 13, 2020·5 min read


_Check out_ [_the first part of this series_](https://medium.com/@toomuchtooless/project-one-skill-a-week-the-beginning-2e9ca843bd7a) _for context._

First things first. How well did I know Photoshop before the week began?

Although I spent considerable time around graphic designers, I had never used it before. I started from ground zero in terms of learning all the commands and controls.

Day 1:

I have access to a lot of graphic designers, but I tried to learn everything the best I could by referring to online guides only. Learning how to open an image in Photoshop came quite intuitively to me, but everything beyond that, I had google. The utility of the various tools are not very intuitive, and there are multiple ways of doing one thing on Photoshop. Hence, I ended up spending quite some time choosing what method to use for doing a particular thing, sayy, removing the background of an object.

I am a huge Queer Eye fan, so this was the first thing I made.

_Thepla_ is a common snack in some parts of India, and one of my absolute favourites. It took me about 45 minutes to make a vector of a _thepla_, and photoshop it in Antoni’s hands. In the original picture, he was eating a slice of pizza. But I reckon he will be quite open to trying a _thepla._

Not gonna lie, the entire exercise made me feel quite powerful. I think I used Refine edge or the Lasso tool, or both. I don’t really recollect at the time of writing this. I will try to make better notes next time.

Next, I decided to photoshop one of my closest friends with Taylor Swift. This was an excruciating process, and one that finally gave me insights into the frustrations that graphic designers face on a daily basis. It took me about an hour to find the right image from which I could successfully remove somebody next to Taylor Swift in order to fit my friend. I ended up picking out a vector of Tay Tay and a background and pasting my friend onto it.

I was too frustrated to fine tune this image, so I left it as it is and called it a day. I was happy with what I had achieved in a couple of hours on my first day. I also became a little more sympathetic towards the specific vector needs of graphic designers. To an outsider, it seems like Photoshop can do absolutely everything. In reality, it’s like a wand that can do a bunch of things, but it’s not all-powerful.

_Wednesday:_

It was a couple of days before I got the time to practise Photoshop again. This time, I was completely out of ideas. So I googled a few photoshop exercises and picked one that gave me a vector of a _ghost_ and a picture of a _ghost castle_. The task was to place some _ghosts_ in the _castle._

The exercise specified what tools to use, but not in much detail. I ended up using the Transformation tools. I tried very hard to change the colour of the ghosts using the eyedropper, but I couldn’t figure out how to do it. Before I knew it, I had spent about an hour and half on this stupid thing. I was looking forward to the weekend so I could gather a little more energy to work on stuff.

Sunday:

I was keen on making a poster or a brochure page before finishing the week. I browsed the web for some inspiration before settling on recreating the famous ‘We Can Do It’ poster from World War II. It was quite different from what I had in mind, but the idea was amusing, so I went ahead with it. Once more, it took me fairly long to figure out how to edit out the text and write something new in its place. In the end, I couldn’t decide on which copy option to share, so here we go.

I wanted to make one real ad before calling it a day. I chose Durex because they make minimal ads, and I didn’t want to do something too extensive. Thinking of the copy and designing the ad at the same time can take up a lot of energy, especially if one is an amateur like me. I don’t know how Akshar Pathak and Pranav Sapra do it.

Picking the exact brand colour for Durex was lengthy process, but finishing the process successfully gave me great satisfaction.

My verdict: I could have benefitted a lot from the use of an actual teacher, but I figured out a fair amount of things on my own. For any aspiring graphic designer reading this, it’s doable. If I can achieve this by practising for 4–10 hours for the duration of a week, you can do a lot if you put your mind to it. There are way too many resources out there to make excuses not to learn.

So far, the one skill a week project has met my expectations quite well. I got everything I wanted – a creative outlet, a chance to learn something new, and a feeling of accomplishment. It would do me well to stick to a skill for 2 weeks. A week is too little but a month is too long. But I can always return to photoshop in a few weeks once I have tried my hand on a few different things.

I haven’t decided on next week’s skill yet, but I am looking forward to it. I’ll be sure to post an update next Sunday.
